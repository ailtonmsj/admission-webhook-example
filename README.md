# Kubernetes Admission Webhook example

This tutoral shows how to build and deploy an [AdmissionWebhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#admission-webhooks).

The Kubernetes [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/) contains a common set of recommended labels that allows tools to work interoperably, describing objects in a common manner that all tools can understand. In addition to supporting tooling, the recommended labels describe applications in a way that can be queried.
In our validating webhook example we make these labels required on deployments and services, so this webhook rejects every deployment and every service that doesnâ€™t have these labels set. The mutating webhook in the example adds all the missing required labels with `not_available` set as the value.

## Prerequisites

Kubernetes 1.9.0 or above with the `admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1` API enabled. Verify that by the following command:
```
kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
```
The result should be:
```
admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
```

In addition, the `MutatingAdmissionWebhook` and `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` admission controllers should be added and listed in the correct order in the admission-control flag of kube-apiserver.

## Build

Set your docker user to terminal:

```
export DOCKER_USER=YOUR_DOCKER_USER
```

Build and push docker image according to your arch ( It is available linux ARM64 and AMD64 )
   
```
./build-arm64 
```
OR
```
./build-amd64 
```

## Deploy

Create a CSR and Secret:

```
./deployment/webhook-create-signed-cert.sh
```

Check if the secret is created:

```
kubectl get secret admission-webhook-example-certs
```

Deploy the rbac, deployment and service:

```
kubectl apply -f deployment/rbac.yaml
```

Check the correct image ( ARM64 OR AMD64 )
```
kubectl create -f deployment/deployment.yaml
```
```
kubectl create -f deployment/service.yaml
```

## Validation Webhook

Important: Remove the Mutating Webhook (if deployed)
It is necessary to remove the validation webhook to avoid conflict, by the logic used in the validation and the mutating

```
kubectl apply -f deployment/mutatingwebhook-ca-bundle.yaml
```

Configure Webhook

It will create a file "deployment/validatingwebhook-ca-bundle.yaml" copy from "deployment/validatingwebhook.yaml" but replacing the CA_BUNDLE placeholder.

```
cat ./deployment/validatingwebhook.yaml | ./deployment/webhook-patch-ca-bundle.sh > ./deployment/validatingwebhook-ca-bundle.yaml
```

Apply the ValidatingWebhookConfiguration:

```
kubectl apply -f deployment/validatingwebhook-ca-bundle.yaml
```

## To test

The validation webhook will validate deployments and services created in namespaces with the label "admission-webhook-example=enabled":

```
kubectl label namespace default admission-webhook-example=enabled
```

Create a deployment or service without the required label ( the validatingwebhook will validate ) and a error will occur:

```
kubectl apply -f deployment/test-deploy.yaml
```

This other command will work:

```
kubectl apply -f deployment/test-deploy-with-labels.yaml
```

To bypass the validating webhook

```
kubectl apply -f deployment/test-deploy-bypass-validation.yaml
```


## Mutating Webhook

Important: Remove the Validating Webhook (if deployed)
It is necessary to remove the validation webhook to avoid conflict, by the logic used in the validation and the mutating

```
kubectl delete -f deployment/validatingwebhook-ca-bundle.yaml
```

Configure Webhook

It will create a file "deployment/mutatingwebhook-ca-bundle.yaml" copy from "deployment/mutatingwebhook.yaml" but replacing the CA_BUNDLE placeholder.

```
cat ./deployment/mutatingwebhook.yaml | ./deployment/webhook-patch-ca-bundle.sh > ./deployment/mutatingwebhook-ca-bundle.yaml
```

Apply the MutatingWebhookConfiguration:

```
kubectl apply -f deployment/mutatingwebhook-ca-bundle.yaml
```

## To test

The mutating webhook will mutate deployments and services created in namespaces with the label "admission-webhook-example=enabled":

```
kubectl label namespace default admission-webhook-example=enabled
```

Create a deployment or service ( the mutatingwebhook will add some labels in the deploy - app.kubernetes.io/component, app.kubernetes.io/instance, app.kubernetes.io/managed-by, app.kubernetes.io/name, app.kubernetes.io/part-of, app.kubernetes.io/version ), no errors will be launch:

```
kubectl apply -f deployment/test-deploy.yaml
```
